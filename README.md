# EZ-AI-Scripting
Lets anyone train a language model using Tensor Flow.
You'll need to install python3, and any dependencies that the scripts may use. Those modules are listed at the top of the scripts, and python3 interpreter will yell at you if you don't have them installed. Recommended to use ubuntu/linux instead of windows.
